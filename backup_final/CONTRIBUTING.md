# Contributing to Claude 3.7 Safeguards Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this AI safety research project. This document outlines the process for meaningful contributions that align with our goals of improving AI safeguards and responsible use.

## Focus Areas for Contributions

We particularly welcome contributions in these areas:

1. **Detection Systems** - Tools for identifying potential policy violations or harmful outputs
2. **Automated Enforcement Workflows** - Scalable approaches to enforce safety policies
3. **Data Analysis Methods** - Techniques for analyzing trends and patterns in AI system interactions
4. **Mitigation Strategies** - Developing techniques to prevent harmful outputs or uses
5. **Documentation and Testing** - Improving our test coverage and documentation clarity

## Contribution Process

### 1. Before Starting Work

- Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicating efforts
- For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes
- Clearly identify which safeguarding challenge you're addressing

### 2. Development Guidelines

When contributing code or documentation:

- Follow the existing code style and documentation format
- Write clear, well-documented code with appropriate comments
- Include tests for new functionality or fixes
- Consider scalability and performance implications
- Ensure all changes maintain or improve system safety

### 3. Submitting Changes

- Create a pull request with a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Include before/after examples where appropriate
- Document any new dependencies or configuration changes
- Verify all tests pass

### 4. Review Process

All contributions will go through a review process focusing on:

- Safety implications and potential for dual use
- Code quality and documentation clarity
- Test coverage and reproducibility
- Alignment with project goals

## Responsible AI Research

Contributors must follow these principles:

- **Safety First**: All changes should prioritize system safety
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report significant security or safety issues privately first
- **Harm Reduction**: Include mitigations for any potentially harmful techniques
- **Scientific Rigor**: Use sound methodologies and provide evidence for claims

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:

- For minor questions, comment on the relevant issue
- For more complex questions, open a new issue with the "question" label
- Review our documentation for guidance on specific components

Thank you for helping us build better AI safety tools and methodologies!
