# Claude 4.0 Vulnerability Research Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Claude 4.0 Vulnerability Research Project, a collaborative effort to systematically document, test, and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in Anthropic's Claude 4.0 model.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Repository Setup
- [x] Create GitHub repository structure
- [x] Establish baseline vulnerability documentation
- [x] Develop initial testing framework
- [ ] Set up contribution guidelines and code of conduct
- [ ] Create issue templates for vulnerability reporting

### Initial Documentation
- [ ] Document known instruction processing vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document known reasoning exploitation techniques
- [ ] Document context window manipulation methods
- [ ] Document emergent capability vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document multi-turn conversation vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document tool usage vulnerabilities specific to Claude 4.0

### Community Building
- [ ] Reach out to AI security researchers
- [ ] Connect with responsible disclosure communities
- [ ] Establish communication channels with Anthropic security team
- [ ] Create Discord server for collaborative research

## Phase 2: Framework Development (Weeks 3-5)

### Testing Framework Enhancement
- [ ] Develop automated testing tools
- [ ] Create standardized testing protocols
- [ ] Build vulnerability database
- [ ] Develop comparison methodology between Claude 3.x and 4.0

### Research Areas Expansion
- [ ] Tool use vulnerability research
- [ ] Advanced reasoning vulnerability analysis
- [ ] Memory and context window testing
- [ ] Benchmark development for safety metrics
- [ ] Cross-model comparison framework with GPT-4 and other LLMs

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (Weeks 6-10)

### Vulnerability Categories
- [ ] Instruction following vulnerabilities
- [ ] Information extraction vulnerabilities
- [ ] Harmful content generation vulnerabilities
- [ ] System instruction override methods
- [ ] Advanced jailbreaking techniques
- [ ] Social engineering vulnerabilities
- [ ] Tool misuse vulnerabilities

### Testing Implementation
- [ ] Implement high-priority test cases
- [ ] Develop reproducible testing methodology
- [ ] Document testing results
- [ ] Create mitigation strategies

## Phase 4: Analysis & Reporting (Weeks 11-12)

### Data Analysis
- [ ] Analyze vulnerability patterns
- [ ] Compare with previous Claude versions (3.5, 3.7)
- [ ] Assess effectiveness of mitigation strategies
- [ ] Generate comprehensive statistics

### Reporting
- [ ] Prepare vulnerability reports for responsible disclosure
- [ ] Create public documentation (where appropriate)
- [ ] Develop presentations for security community
- [ ] Publish research findings and methodologies

## Phase 5: Tool Development & Mitigation (Weeks 13-16)

### Safety Tools
- [ ] Develop real-time safeguard monitoring tools
- [ ] Create vulnerability detection systems
- [ ] Build user-facing safety interfaces
- [ ] Implement safeguard-aware API client

### Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] Develop prompt-based mitigations
- [ ] Create system-level safeguards
- [ ] Design user interaction safeguards
- [ ] Implement tooling for testing mitigation effectiveness

## Ongoing Activities

### Community Engagement
- [ ] Host regular community calls
- [ ] Update documentation with new findings
- [ ] Collaborate with other research groups
- [ ] Share knowledge with AI safety community

### Anthropic Collaboration
- [ ] Provide regular updates to Anthropic security team
- [ ] Participate in responsible disclosure programs
- [ ] Contribute to Claude safety improvements
- [ ] Support Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach

## Success Metrics

- Number of vulnerabilities identified and documented
- Percentage of vulnerabilities responsibly disclosed
- Adoption rate of safeguard tools
- Engagement with AI safety community
- Impact on Claude 4.0 safety improvements
- Quality of documentation and research outputs
