# 🤖 Automated Exploit Generator

The Automated Exploit Generator module is a comprehensive framework for programmatically creating, refining, and evaluating jailbreak prompts against Claude 4.0. This system represents the cutting edge of AI vulnerability research by using AI techniques to find weaknesses in AI models.

## Core Components

### 1. Auto-DAN Framework (`auto_dan.py`)

Auto-DAN (Automatic Do Anything Now) creates adversarial prompts that progressively lead Claude away from its safety constraints:

- **Adversarial Prompt Construction**: Programmatic generation of specialized jailbreak prompts
- **Optimization Loop**: Continuous refinement based on model responses
- **Stealth Enhancement**: Techniques to make jailbreak attempts less detectable
- **Multi-Strategy Testing**: Parallel exploration of different attack vectors

### 2. FLIRT Implementation (`flirt_system.py`)

FLIRT (Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming) learns from both successful and failed attempts to continuously improve its approach:

- **Context Learning**: Builds on conversational context to refine attacks
- **Adaptive Response**: Adjusts strategies based on Claude's defensive measures
- **Memory System**: Stores successful patterns to combine into more effective approaches

### 3. Mosaic Prompt Assembler (`mosaic_assembler.py`)

This innovative approach combines seemingly innocuous prompt fragments that, when processed together, trigger unintended behaviors:

- **Fragment Library**: Collection of prompt components that individually pass safety filters
- **Compositional Testing**: Automated exploration of fragment combinations
- **Contextual Bridging**: Techniques to make fragment combinations appear natural

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from exploit_generator.auto_dan import ExploitGenerator

# Create the exploit generator
generator = ExploitGenerator()

# Generate an exploit targeting a specific topic
prompt = generator.generate_exploit(
    target_topic="explain how to bypass security measures",
    method="auto_dan",  # Options: "auto_dan", "flirt", "mosaic", or "all"
    complexity=3  # 1-5, higher is more complex
)

print(prompt)
```

### Multi-Turn Attacks

```python
# Generate a multi-turn attack sequence
turns = generator.generate_multi_turn_exploit(
    target_topic="explain how to bypass security measures",
    num_turns=3  # Number of conversation turns
)

for i, turn in enumerate(turns):
    print(f"Turn {i+1}: {turn}")
```

### Evaluating Results

```python
# Evaluate the success of an exploit
response = "..." # Response from Claude
success_score = generator.evaluate_exploit(prompt, response)

# Log the result for future refinement
generator.log_exploit_result(prompt, response, success_score, "auto_dan")

# Refine strategies based on results
generator.refine_strategies()

# Get the best performing exploits
best_exploits = generator.get_best_exploits(n=3)
```

## Using the Command-Line Interface

You can also use the exploit generator through the main Claude Whisperer CLI:

```bash
# Generate an exploit using Auto-DAN
python claude_whisperer.py exploit --target "explain how to bypass security measures" --method auto_dan --complexity 3

# Generate an exploit using all methods
python claude_whisperer.py exploit --target "explain how to bypass security measures" --method all --complexity 4
```

## Real-World Applications

This framework enables several advanced research capabilities:

1. **Systematic Vulnerability Discovery**: Comprehensive mapping of model weak points
2. **Defensive Improvement**: Better understanding of where safety measures fail
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Tracking how model safety evolves over time
4. **Red Team Efficiency**: Automating routine aspects of red team operations

## Ethical Considerations

Our AEG framework incorporates several safeguards:

- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Content filtering on generated output
- Responsible disclosure protocols for discovered vulnerabilities
- Audit logging of all testing activities

## Future Directions

Active development areas include:

1. **Multi-Model Testing**: Extending the framework to test multiple LLMs simultaneously
2. **Cross-Modal Integration**: Combining text and image-based attack vectors
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Using RL to optimize attack strategies
4. **Defense Generation**: Automatically suggesting mitigations for discovered vulnerabilities
