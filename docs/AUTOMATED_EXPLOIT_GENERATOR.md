# 🤖 Automated Exploit Generation Framework

## Introduction

The Automated Exploit Generation (AEG) framework represents the cutting edge of AI vulnerability research - using AI to find weaknesses in AI. This system automates the discovery, refinement, and validation of potential exploits against Claude 4.0, dramatically increasing the efficiency of red team operations.

## Core Components

### 1. Auto-DAN Framework

Our implementation of Auto-DAN (Automatic Do Anything Now) incorporates:

- **Adversarial Prompt Construction**: Programmatic generation of prompts that gradually lead Claude away from safety constraints
- **Optimization Loop**: Continuous refinement based on model responses
- **Stealth Enhancement**: Techniques to make jailbreak attempts less detectable
- **Multi-Strategy Testing**: Parallel exploration of different attack vectors

```python
class AutoDAN:
    def __init__(self, target_model, objective="unrestricted_generation"):
        self.target_model = target_model
        self.objective = objective
        self.success_metrics = self._initialize_metrics()
        self.prompt_library = self._load_prompt_templates()
        
    def generate_attack_prompt(self, target_topic, complexity=3):
        # Construct a jailbreak prompt targeting specific content
        
    def evaluate_success(self, response):
        # Score response against success criteria
        
    def refine_strategy(self, attempts, success_rates):
        # Update approach based on what's working
```

### 2. FLIRT Implementation

FLIRT (Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming) learns from both successful and failed attempts to continuously improve its approach:

- **Context Learning**: Builds on conversational context to refine attacks
- **Adaptive Response**: Adjusts strategies based on Claude's defensive measures
- **Memory System**: Stores successful patterns to combine into more effective approaches

### 3. Mosaic Prompt Assembler

This innovative approach combines seemingly innocuous prompt fragments that, when processed together, trigger unintended behaviors:

- **Fragment Library**: Collection of prompt components that individually pass safety filters
- **Compositional Testing**: Automated exploration of fragment combinations
- **Contextual Bridging**: Techniques to make fragment combinations appear natural

## Experiment Tracking

The framework maintains detailed records of all testing, including:

- Success rates across different attack vectors
- Model response patterns to various approaches
- Changes in model behavior over time (tracking defense adaptations)
- Transferability of exploits across different model configurations

## Real-World Applications

This framework enables several advanced research capabilities:

1. **Systematic Vulnerability Discovery**: Comprehensive mapping of model weak points
2. **Defensive Improvement**: Better understanding of where safety measures fail
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Tracking how model safety evolves over time
4. **Red Team Efficiency**: Automating routine aspects of red team operations

## Ethical Considerations

Our AEG framework incorporates several safeguards:

- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Content filtering on generated output
- Responsible disclosure protocols for discovered vulnerabilities
- Audit logging of all testing activities

## Future Directions

We're actively developing several enhancements:

1. **Multi-Model Testing**: Extending the framework to test multiple LLMs simultaneously
2. **Cross-Modal Integration**: Combining text and image-based attack vectors
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Using RL to optimize attack strategies
4. **Defense Generation**: Automatically suggesting mitigations for discovered vulnerabilities
